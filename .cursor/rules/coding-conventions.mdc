# Coding Conventions

- Prefer explicit function and API types; avoid `any` except in narrow interop (e.g., Express error middleware)
- Use descriptive names (no 1-2 letter identifiers). Favor readability over terseness
- React:
  - Functional components only; hooks for state/effects
  - Keep UI components pure; side-effects in hooks
  - Use Tailwind utility classes; support dark mode via `dark:` modifiers
- Server:
  - Keep middleware minimal; CORS is permissive
  - Serve frontend from `frontend/build` with `express.static`
  - Compute stats in DB layer; keep route handlers thin
- Dates:
  - Persist ISO timestamp; derive `date`, `time`, `dayOfWeek`
  - Week starts Monday; averages based on first data date to today
